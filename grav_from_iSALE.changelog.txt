#GRAV_FROM_ISALE.PY CHANGELOG AND TODO

##Known Issues
- Plotter runs using NumPy, which isn't the most portable of solutions; I should
  probably make a substitute GMT plotter
- Currently can't handle input with a high-res zone that isn't on the left
  edge (axisymmetric axis) of the model

##Changelog
- **20150511** (v.3)
    - updated copyright info
- **20140501** (v.3)
    - removed "debug" code for release, updated copyright info
- **20130602** (v2.2)
    - cleaned up argument parsing (made it match with `grav_anomaly.py`)
    - fixed issues relating to the way the program matched up data-file values
      with the positions of cells during parsing; code wasn't working when tested
      this morning, now appears to be functional
- **20130111** (v2.0)
    - sweeping changes; moved things around so that this program (formerly
      called "nodes_from_iSALE.py") now processes _both_ the iSALE input and
      data files, and generates a ".grav" file just like the _Abaqus_ output
- **20130110**
    - bumped version number to 0.2
    - Re-did command-line implementation using `argparse`
    - Created this changelog file
- **20120820**
    - Created program (date may be slightly off)
